# TO DO!

- DEADLINE FOR SCRIPT: 13-02-2015

* Low priority:
	
	- Need to add a license before making repository public! (when done)

* Direct priority:

	- Finish up the scraper

## Python:

- Add Johanna's email address to the script

## R:

- Feature engineering (i.e. creating categories). Use regular expression to find words associated with certain categories (e.g. 'harras')

	1. Take out all capitals
	2. take out all punctuation (!*&%$ etc)
	3. Remove stopwords
	4. Create binary matrix (0/1 | Yes/No values)

## Specific:

- Geolocating : Fixed. Added function in 'naija_scrape.py' that takes the geolocation straight from the report.
